STOPPING CONDITION
- how can we have a terminating condition that is non global?

WHAT VALUES ARE TRACKED
- number of load activity. should we care about the amount of load
transfered from a unit to its neigbors? or should we just think of 
it a YES/NO transfered
- number of cycles

DETERMINING IF LOAD SHOULD BE TRANSFERED FROM G TO A OR B
- compute the average load between A,B,G
- IF G has excess load over the average and B or A 
has insufficient load, transfer as much load as possible from G
so that, 1) G still has greater than or equal to average load
2) the unit with insufficient load has less than or equal to average load

SCHEDULING LOAD BALANCING
- initially each proccesser is randomly assigned a cycyle
- global cycle count initialized to 1
- repeat
    - sort the list of processors by their appointment time
    - take the difference between the proccessor with 1st appointment 
      and the global count, d, and add d to global counter
    - if the unit in question can distribute load, do it and update load activity counter
    - otherwise schedule the next appointment for that unit. 
    - make sure list is ordered correctly from nearest appointment times to highest


GENERATE RESULTS GRAPH
- constants are 
- as we vary the number of proccesors what happens to load balancing activity rate?
- what happens to the number of cycles required? 
- k = {5,10,100,1000}
- load between [10,1000]
- load activity between [100,1000]
